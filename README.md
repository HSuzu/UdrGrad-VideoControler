# Wishbone VGA Controller

This was developed as a projet for SE204 @ Télécom Paris, promo 2020.
The base code for this project was developed by professors of this module, Yves Mathieu et Tarik Graba.

The description of the project can be found at [https://sen.enst.fr/se204/un-controleur-video](https://sen.enst.fr/se204/un-controleur-video).

In this project we implemented in a FPGA a bus Wishbone that served as a communication path between the VGA video controller (implemented by us) and the sources of video.
